# Portfolio-Website

I am slowly working on creating my portfoio site from scratch. I will either be using Azure or GitHub pages for hosting. The choice depending on how complex I'd like it to be. I am trying to build it on Azure first, with authentication for myself to sign in and create blog posts. I could take the slightly easier option of having blog posts and the like being held in a JSON format and create posts by adding to those JSON files, but I'd like to attempt to use ASP.NET Core and MVC/ Razor, Azure and all the goodies to make a more meaningful addition to my portfolio as well as strengthen my skills in these departments as I feel I am much weaker here.

Nothing to show for now, you can look through the code, but it's a lot of boilerplate stuff and models.
